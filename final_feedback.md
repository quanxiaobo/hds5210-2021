Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Very well organized and documented.  Thank you for making your work a pleasure to read through.

Love the use of box/whisker and violin plots.  That's a great way to compare distributions across multiple cities.

Tip - shorten feature/column names whenever you can.  For instance, the "Category - linear mean score" could have been easier to read in some fo the charts if you'd dropped the "- linear mean score" from the column name.

You did a great job putting into use all of the techniques we discussed this year AND took it the step further to do more rigorous statistical analysis nice work.
